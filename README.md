# Supply-Chain-Analysis
## Overview
The primary goal of this project was to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the supply chain operations. By leveraging data-driven insights, we aimed to identify areas for optimization, enhance efficiency, and improve overall performance metrics within the supply chain.

## Dataset Overview
Our analysis centered around a robust dataset encompassing various aspects of the supply chain, including Order Numbers, Sales Channels, Warehouse Codes, Procurement Dates, Shipping and Delivery Dates, Currency Codes, Sales Team and Customer IDs, Store and Product IDs, Order Quantities, Discounts Applied, Unit Costs, and Unit Prices.

## Methodology
The project utilized advanced data analytics and visualization tools, primarily Power BI, to process and analyze the data. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as Order Fulfillment Time, Procurement Lead Time, Shipping Time etc.

## Key Insights
### Financial Overview:
1. The profit for 2018 was 4.92 million (40.49%) against a revenue of 17.08 million.
2. In 2019 profit of 8.14 million (41.38%) was recorded against a revenue of 27.81 million.
3. And in 2020 showed a profit of 8.16 million (40.80%) on a revenue of 28.14 million.

### Operational Efficiency:
1. Instore and wholesale channels demonstrate quicker order fulfillment, suggesting efficient processing in these areas.
2. The months of March and April experienced the highest average procurement lead time, possibly indicating supplier or seasonal challenges.
3. Average shipping days stand at 6, while average processing days are 21 and average Procurement Lead days are 124.
4. July and December saw peak order quantities, with March at the low end. We can increase stock levels and staffing in anticipation of high-demand months.

### Profitability and Sales Performance:
1. Warehouse WARE-NBV1002 is experiencing notably low order volumes, while WARE-NMK1003 is handling the highest number of orders. We can reallocate some resources or inventory from WARE-NMK1003 to WARE-NBV1002 to better balance the workload and improve overall efficiency.
2. Stores with IDs 284, 26, 238, 166, and 33 rank highest in revenue generation, contrasting sharply with the lower revenues from stores 108, 109, 10, 53, and 118. We can enhance marketing efforts in lower-performing stores and providing additional training and resources to underperforming store teams to boost their sales effectiveness.
3. Sales Teams 1, 18, and 9 report minimal profit percentages, highlighting areas for potential sales training or strategy refinement.
4. Products with IDs 15, 31, 13, 29, and 40 exhibit lower profit percentages, signaling a need for pricing or cost optimization strategies.
